Application to allow on demand logging

What does it do and what not:
----------------------------
a. ftee clones stdin to stdout and to a named pipe which allows so called on-demand logging which
	is apparently usable in embedded aplications
b. user can in some moment in time 'subscribe' to the log and see the process output
	and then 'unsubscribe' when finished inspecting the log
c. *only one* process can subscribe to the log
c. most people might want to detach the terminal where the process was started, see below

How to use it:
---------------------------
$ mkfifo /tmp/mylog
$ ping www.google.com | ftee /tmp/mylog > /dev/null &
$ cat /tmp/mylog

The above: 
a.	creates fifo to which we'll want to 'subscribe'
b.	launches the process for which we want to log the stdout and 
	pipes its output to ftee which in turn clones it to stdout and the named pipe.
	In this example we get rid of the stdout by redirecting it to /dev/null and send 
	the whole process into the background.
c.	We subscribe to the log (^C to unsubscribe) - this works only for one process 'catting' on the fifo
